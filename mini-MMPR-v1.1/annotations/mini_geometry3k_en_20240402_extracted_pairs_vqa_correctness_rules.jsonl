Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. The angles inside the square add up to 360°. The angles around the circle add up to 360°.\n\n2. Let's begin with the angles around the square. We know that:\n   - One of the angles is \\(60°\\).\n   - The angle adjacent to \\(60°\\) and the angle \\(105°\\).\n   - The intersection point opposite \\(60°\\) is \\(105° + 5x°\\).\n\n3. Since the interior angles of a square add up to \\(360°\\), set up the equation:\n   \\[\n   60° + 5x° + 5x° + 105° = 360°\n   \\]\n\n4. Simplify the equation:\n   \\[\n   60° + 10x° + 105° = 360°\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   165° + 10x° = 360°\n   \\]\n\n5. Solve for \\(10x°\\):\n   \\[\n   10x° = 360° - 165°\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   10x° = 195°\n   \\]\n\n6. Divide both sides by 10 to solve for \\(x°\\):\n   \\[\n   x° = \\frac{195°}{10}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x° = 19.5°\n   \\]\n\nThe steps show that the steps we've taken lead to the fact that \\(x = 19.5\\).\n\nHowever, it seems there is an error. Reassess the angles and calculations, you may need to consider more carefully the intersections and angles involving the circle and the square.\n\nUpon re-reading the problem, the angles involving the tangent to the circle should also be checked for consistency:\n\nCorrected:\nThe correct step involves the angles formed where the square's corners are tangent to the circle. The correct calculation is:\n\nBy adding angles in a straight line formed by tangents, there's a more detailed understanding.\n\nLet's resolve the corrected:\n- By recognizing the full circle and checking the right angles, there is a misalignment in previously discussed angle sums in squares' internal, and that can lead to confusion - recheck or solve with consistency.\n\nFinal answer: 18", "answer_gt": "9", "image_wh": [[309, 172]]}
